# haskell-exprs

Just getting back into the swing of some elementary Haskell

This will be my second attempt at learning Haskell, *very slowly*

I'll put a list of resources and references together when I get a mo'!

### To Do

* ~~Implement Basic Expression Evaluation~~
* Implement Expression Evaluation using Trees
* *Think of some more other examples*
